- we need 2 PCAs based on the scree plot

PC is the biggest PC based on the proportion of variance

Q1 - The first principal component (PC1) explains the largest proportion of variance in the stock return dataset (~27%). When we compare PC1 to the market return (S&P500), we observe a very strong linear relationship, with a high absolute correlation. Although the relationship is negative, this is a result of PCA’s arbitrary sign convention — flipping the direction of PC1 would make the correlation positive. Thus, PC1 can be interpreted as capturing the broad market factor, consistent with the belief that the largest principal component coincides with market movements.

Q2 - The first latent factor shows the greatest loading for Construction and Finance/Insurance/RE, confirming that these industries are most exposed to broad systematic market movements. When shifting to the second factor, however, the pattern changes: Finance/Insurance/RE remains significant, but Mining and Wholesale Trade also exhibit stronger loadings. This suggests that Factor 1 represents market-wide risk, while Factor 2 reflects more sector-specific drivers such as financial or commodity-linked shocks.

Q2.2 *real* - On the first latent factor, the Construction industry (C) has the greatest loading, indicating that it is most strongly associated with the broad, market-wide component of returns. This suggests that Construction is the industry most exposed to systematic market risk.

However, the analysis changes when additional factors are considered. In the two-factor model, the second factor loads most heavily on Mining (B) and Wholesale Trade (F), capturing variation that is distinct from the overall market and likely tied to commodity or trade-related shocks. Extending the model to three factors reveals that the Finance/Insurance/Real Estate (H) industry has the highest loading on the third factor, which can be interpreted as financial or credit-driven risk.

Taken together, this shows that while Construction dominates the first, market-like factor, different industries become most relevant once we allow for additional sources of systematic variation. The conclusion therefore does change across factors: Factor 1 highlights Construction, Factor 2 highlights Mining/Wholesale Trade, and Factor 3 highlights Finance.

Q3 - From the factor analysis results, all industries show positive loadings on both factors, meaning no industry group moves in the opposite direction of the common factors. Instead, every group co-moves positively with the latent components.

On Factor 1, the strongest loadings are for Construction (C, 0.49), Finance/Insurance/Real Estate (H, 0.43), and Transport & Utilities (E, 0.42). This suggests these industries are the most exposed to the broad systematic risk captured by the first factor. On Factor 2, the largest loadings are observed for Finance/Insurance/Real Estate (H, 0.37) and Wholesale Trade (F, 0.29), indicating that these industries are more sensitive to the secondary source of systematic variation.

There is clear heterogeneity in factor loadings across industries. While all groups share positive exposure, the magnitudes differ: Construction and Finance are strongly tied to Factor 1, while Retail (G, 0.27) and Services (I, 0.35) have weaker exposures. Similarly, Factor 2 highlights Finance and Wholesale, while Services (I, 0.12) and Manufacturing (D, 0.16) load much less. This unevenness shows that although all industries are influenced by the common factors, some are far more sensitive to systematic risk than others.
